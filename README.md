## Problem Domain

This application was developed for a Dear Junior Dev Hackathon, between March 24 and April 2, 2023. Requirements:

**Frontend:**

- Each planet of the solar system must have its own profile page.
- Each page must include at a minimum (Name of the planet, size, distance from the Sun, three identifying facts, solid or gas core, and a visual representation of the planet)
- ***NOTE:*** *No images, assets, emojis, or SVGs are permitted. The visual representation of each planet must be made ENTIRELY out of CSS.*
- If the planet has a moon, you must display the following information for every moon (Name, history behind name, and size).
- Planet pages must include at least two different component styles.
- If a planet has more than one moon, the moon information must be displayed in repeating elements.
- All planet and moon content MUST be stored in a database.

**Backend:**

- You must use foreign keys.
- Planets and Moons must be stored separate from one another.
- You must incorporate one ENUM for the planet data.
- ENUM used for the planet data is the type of planet: dwarf planet, ice, terrestrial, gas

**Homepage:**

- The homepage should be an overview of the solar system.
- The data included will be up to each team.
- The homepage must include at least two components that are NOT used on any planet page.
- Homepage content does not need to be stored in a database and can be coded into your components.
